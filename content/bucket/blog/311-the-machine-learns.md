Some things seem like Science Fiction. Then you realise they’re here
now. Machine Learning’s like that.

You’re using it today! When you mark an email as Spam,
The Machine learns, improving its automatic detection rate for you and
everyone else. Through learning by example, The Machine mimics the way
the human brain works. The Machine uses a Neural Net, similar
to the arrangement of the brain cells in humans, but built
in software or fast Silicon hardware, not biological cells.

For more advanced examples, see “AlphaGo - The Movie”. It isn’t
a science fiction movie like “ex Machina”; it’s a documentary about
the application of Machine Learning to vocations for which humans spend
years in intensive training and rely on “human intuition”. Tasks which
have previously been thought beyond the bounds of computers’ capability. Making
machines not just as good as an average human, but better
than the best expert in the field. After trouncing world champions
in the game of Go, the AlphaGo team is setting its
sights on medical diagnosis that’s better than the best experts’. A
few years ago I’d have thought that impossible in my lifetime,
but now a certainty. [AlphaGo - the Movie is a real
eye-opener and free to view on Youtube](https://youtu.be/WXuK6gekU1Y)

So what does that mean for your business? Let’s consider the
Threats before the Opportunities. Someone, somewhere is thinking of using Machine
Learning to do what your business does, better and at a
fraction of the price. For Amazon, Google, Facebook, Uber, Netflix, Tesla
and thousands of venture capital backed start-ups, it’s in their business
DNA. Driving cars: yes, you see that on TV. Cutting hair - yes, why ever not.
They’ll do what you do, better and at a lower price, sooner than you think.

The Opportunity with the biggest prize is to become the leader
in applying Machine Learning to your field, potentially dominating the market.
If that’s what you want to do, you’ll need to capture
a lot of relevant but tiny pieces of information about the
running of your business, feed it into The Machine, and turn
it into something world beating with the help of some very
clever and creative technical specialists. Like Google did with Spam detection
and AlphaGo. If you’ve got the ambition, the vision, the nouse
and the stamina then people will want to pump more money
into your venture than you’ll know what to do with.

You could work in partnership with a specialist company or form
a joint venture with other businesses in your field. Make a
good case why they need you rather than another company in
your field. It doesn’t have to be an academic research project.
You can build applications using pre-trained generic building blocks; from Amazon
AWS for example:

- [Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) is for finding insights and relationships in text,
- [Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?blog-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&blog-cards.sort-order=desc) is for image and video analysis: identify objects, people,
  text, scenes, and activities in images and videos, as well as
  detect any inappropriate content,
- [Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) is for building conversational interfaces using voice and text,
- [Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/) is for building real-time personalized recommendations for your customers,
- [Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/) is a neural machine translation service for fast, high-quality,
  and affordable language translation
- [Polly's](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) Neural Text-to-Speech (NTTS) turns text into natural sounding human
  speech allowing you to create applications that talk, and build entirely
  new categories of speech-enabled products

More simply, you can use off-the-shelf products in your business that
incorporate Machine Learning. Starting from a basic capability the products learn
what works for your business from your feedback. Actively watch out
for new game changing technology that gives your business an edge
over your competition. For example:

- automating processing of paper and e-paper: receipts, invoices, recruitment etc,
- image recognition: faces, vehicles, objects,
- customer service: chatbots, voice response, or
- cybersecurity

That’s why you need a forward looking company like telanova. We
work with you to select the IT that’s right for your
business from the best of current IT, whether that’s using machine
learning, other innovations or other traditional approaches. We integrate new IT
into your existing systems, train your colleagues in new ways of
working and maintain your edge over the competition.
